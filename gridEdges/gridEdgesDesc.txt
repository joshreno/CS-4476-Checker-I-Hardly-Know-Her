We had initially planned on using edge detection to build the grid for the pieces. The images show that finding the edges is
actually fairly trivial, but attempting to create a grid, or rather an 8x8 matrix for the pieces may not actually be useful.
Our detection of the pieces themselves can be used instead to detect and create the grid for the piece locations that the 
checkers AI will use. In the gridEdgeDetection we can see it produces a very obvious board, but turning this data into an 8x8 matrix
with locations of pieces is less ideal as we can see in the pictures and our circle detection finds them much easier. In the future
we may combine these two to build the grid.
