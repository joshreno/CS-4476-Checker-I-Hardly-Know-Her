Approach:
The steps to solve this problem are fairly straight forward.
1. Detect the edges of the grid on the board
2. Create an 8x8 matrix of the grid space for the spaces
3. Map the pieces to the matrix 
4. Give the matrix to the checkers AI

Experiments and Results:
We had initially planned on using edge detection to build the grid for the pieces. The images show that finding the edges is
actually fairly trivial, but attempting to create a grid, or rather an 8x8 matrix for the pieces may not actually be useful.
Our detection of the pieces themselves can be used instead to detect and create the grid for the piece locations that the 
checkers AI will use. In the gridEdgeDetection we can see it produces a very obvious board, but turning this data into an 8x8 matrix
with locations of pieces is less ideal as we can see in the pictures and our circle detection finds them much easier. In the future
we may combine these two to build the grid.

Qualitative results:
See folder 'gridEdges' for output images of each step.

Conclusion and future work:
We will either need to find a proper way to create the matrix with the image or move on to the pure circle detection method using distance between pieces to assign places in the matrix.
